# Abstract
Age is often associated with health and well-being, especially in terms of transmission and infection. Within this paper, analysis of COVID-19 cases in Toronto was compared to various age groups to gauge treatment and outcomes. It was discovered that senior patients received more treatment in terms of hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, and intubation. However, senior Torontonians were among the highest age group to also see fatal outcomes. For example, 23% of cases with patients ages 90 and over received hospitalization, but 30% of these cases ended in fatality. By analyzing this data, results may help guide a more nuanced understanding of how COVID-19 treatment and outcomes differ by a factor of patients' age.
